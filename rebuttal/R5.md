**Small benchmark datasets:** Due to constraints in computational resources, we initially conducted experiments on a set of small but widely used benchmark datasets. To further validate the generalizability of our approach, we are including experiments on larger datasets, such as SST-2 (67K examples), and the corresponding results are as follows:
